### A simple deck of cards

This app renders a deck of playing cards on a page. You can Shuffle, Sort and Draw the cards.

##### Installation
    npm install

##### Run the server
    grunt serve

  The app runs on port 9001 and this port is defined in Gruntfile.js. If you'd prefer to use a different port, change it before you start the server. Once the server is up, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

##### Run the tests 
    grunt test
  
 or you can also run the [browser test runner](http://localhost:9001/node_modules/intern/client.html?config=tests/intern), if you fancy the nice UI provided by Intern.
